Inspired from another project I've seen online, I decided to integrate React instead of Angular.
Based on an example I've found, I changed several elements in order to create a look and file related to coffee and the New School (with the logo for example). The react application is basically an extension of the website and an app tha I created for my Major Studio.

The card animation would also be suitable for banks or online stores. Credits to Jasmin MIF for the .
I hope everything is connected now- even if you download it from github. If not, please watch the video to see how it looks, especially the card animation.

You must run this command before start the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
